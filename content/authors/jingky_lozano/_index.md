## Biography
### Background

I am a biostatistician and genetic epidemiologist with a broad experience in international health research and teaching in both academic and industry settings. Since 1993, I have designed and implemented health studies, analysed clinical trials and conducted training courses in statistical analysis and research methods for government institutions, pharmaceutical companies and international organizations.  Prior to joining Newcastle University in 2022, I have held research and academic appointments at Imperial College London, University of Oxford, University of GÃ¶ttingen (Germany) and University of the Philippines. 

### Research 

My current research interest includes the following:
-	Modelling techniques that could be efficiently applied to answer questions on identification of disease states, treatment efficacy, treatment cost-effectiveness and disease prevention
-	Applications of AI in biomarker studies, healthcare and clinical trials
-	Population and family-based analysis methods in genetics
