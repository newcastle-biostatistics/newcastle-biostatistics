## Background

I joined the [PHSI](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/health-sciences/) Biostatistics Research Group in January 2021 as a Research Associate working with [Professor James Wason](/staff/james_wason).
I am interested in the development of novel clinical trial designs and will be working on a mixture of methodological research (in the area of precision medicine) and applying new methods in practice. 

Qualifications: 

PhD Statistics and Operational Research, STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, Lancaster University
  - Thesis Title: Bayesian Bandit Models for the Design of Clinical Trials
  - Supervisors: [Prof. Thomas Jaki](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/thomas-jaki) (Statistics) and [Dr. Peter Jacko](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/peter-jacko) (Management Science)
  
MRes Statistics and Operational Research, STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, Lancaster University

BSc Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University

## Research

My research interests include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

  1. The use of response-adaptive randomisation in clinical trials;
  2. Personalising treatment allocation in clinical trials;
  3. Overcoming barriers which prevent the application of novel trial designs in practice.
