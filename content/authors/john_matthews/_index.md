## Background

I came to [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) in 1987, following undergraduate and postgraduate studies in mathematics and statistics at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), a PhD at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) with Professor Michael Healy and a post-doctoral appointment at [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) with Professor Peter Armitage.

I was awarded the [Guy Medal in Bronze](https://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/About/Recognising_Statistical_Excellence/Honours/Guy_Medals/RSS/About_the_RSS/Recognising_statistical_excellence_sub/Guy_Medals.aspx?hkey=38a59a2e-177e-4c59-ab66-47e6bc9685a8) of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://www.rss.org.uk/) in 1996 and served as President of the [British and Irish Region](https://biometricsociety.org.uk/) of the [International Biometric Society](https://www.biometricsociety.org/) from 2014-16.

I retired from the university in 2022, becoming an Emeritus Professor. I remain involved in several projects and activities within the Biostatistics Research Group.
