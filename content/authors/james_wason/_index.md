## Background

I am a statistician with interests in methods for improving the design and analysis of clinical trials.
As well as working in methodology development I have a great interest in collaborating on real trials to apply new methods in practice.

I have been at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) since July 2017.

### Areas of expertise

- Biostatistics
- Clinical trials
- Novel trial design

## Research

My research focuses on statistical methods for improved design and analysis of clinical trials.
I am particularly interested in:

1. Adaptive designs for clinical trials;
2. Methods for incorporating biomarkers into clinical trials to stratify patients by treatment response;
3. Improved methods for analysing composite endpoints, in particular ones with continuous components.
