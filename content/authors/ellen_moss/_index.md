## Background 

I joined the [PHSI](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/health-sciences/) Biostatistics Research Group in 2022 to work on several projects with Professor James Wason. Prior to this, I completed my PhD and several previous Research Associate positions in the School of Natural and Environmental Sciences (also at Newcastle University).

I'm a biological modeller that focusses on investigating and solving problems in complex biological systems. I have worked on a wide range of ecology, entomology, and epidemiology projects. I am particularly interested in using observational datasets (e.g. routinely collected health data, citizen science data) to support decision-making and improve outcomes. 

## Research 

Analysing complex observational datasets
Spatio-temporal modelling
Machine learning methods
Clinical trial emulation and augmentation
