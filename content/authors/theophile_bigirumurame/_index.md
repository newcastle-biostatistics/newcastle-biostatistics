## Background

I joined the [PHSI](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/health-sciences/) (former IHS) Biostatistics Research Group in August 2017.
Before joining the group, I was working as a Medical Statistician within the School of Medicine, Pharmacy & Health, [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), Queen’s campus.
I completed my Postgraduate degree and PhD at the Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics for statistics, [Hasselt University](https://www.uhasselt.be/en), Belgium.
