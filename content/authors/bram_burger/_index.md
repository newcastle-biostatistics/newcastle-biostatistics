## Background 

I joined the [PHSI](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/health-sciences/) Biostatistics Research Group in August 2022.
Before coming to the UK, I worked as biostatistician/bioinformatician at the department of Medical Genetics  at Haukeland university hospital and the Diabetes Research group at the University of Bergen, Norway. My PhD was on the topic of statistical design and analysis of proteomics experiments with the Computational Biology Unit (CBU) and Proteomics Unit (PROBE) at the University of Bergen. I received my MSc in biostatistics and statistical bioinformatics at Hasselt University, Belgium, where I also worked briefly on the topic of randomisation tests.

My current work focuses on efficient design of pre-clinical experiments
