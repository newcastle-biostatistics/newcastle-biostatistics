I am a biostatistician with experience in biomedical research, clinical trials and research integrity.
My recent biomedical research interests include randomised trial designs, treatment induced clustering, partially nested designs and pilot and feasibility studies.

I lead the Biostatistics Research Group in the [Population Health Sciences Institute](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/institutes/population-health/), co-lead the [Innovation, Methodology and Application Research Theme](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/research/research-themes/innovation/) and since 2021 I am Deputy Director for the [Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nctu/).

Nationally, I am Chair of the [NIHR Methodology Incubator](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/methodology-incubator/25041) and co-lead of the [NIHR Statistics Group](https://statistics-group.nihr.ac.uk/).
