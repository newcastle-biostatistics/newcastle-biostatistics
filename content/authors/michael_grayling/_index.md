## Background

I am a [Newcastle University Research Fellow](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medicalsciences/research/career-development/fellowship/#overview) in Biostatistics, interested in methodology for improving the design and analysis of clinical trials.
As well as working on developing methodology, I also collaborate on real trials.

I have been at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/) since November 2018.
Prior to this I was a Statistician at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/).
