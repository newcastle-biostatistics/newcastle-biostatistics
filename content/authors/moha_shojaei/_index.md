## Background 



I hold a PhD in biostatistics. I have been working on Zero Inflated Data, Mixed Random Effect models, and Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data for more than five years. I am therefore interested in using my statistical knowledge in a field which requires high levels of analytical and problem-solving capabilities.
I have been in Newcastle since September 2022. I am part of the Biostatistics Research Group.
