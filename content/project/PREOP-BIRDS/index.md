PRE-OP BIRDS was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI Chris Snowden and team.

It aimed to investigate the feasibility of introducing a screening process to assess adult preoperative drinking levels and to deliver a brief behavioural intervention adapted for the target population group.
