FAB was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's RfPB Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/research-for-patient-benefit.htm) to PI [Aditya Sharma](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/adityasharma.html) and team.

It was the first mixed-methods UK trial examining the feasibility and acceptability of a future definitive RCT to evaluate whether Family Focussed Treatment for Adolescents with Bipolar Disorder (FFT-A)  can improve family functioning and well-being as part of the management of Paediatric Bipolar Disorder.
