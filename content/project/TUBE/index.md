TUBE was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Vinidh Paleri](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/our-consultants-units-and-wards/consultant-directory/professor-vinidh-paleri) and team.

It was a mixed-methods multicentre study to establish the feasibility of a RCT comparing oral feeding plus pre-treatment gastrostomy with oral feeding plus as-required nasogastric tube feeding in patients with HNSCC. 

You can find out more from TUBE's [award page](https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/programmes/hta/123532/#/), or from it's [final report](https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22160).
