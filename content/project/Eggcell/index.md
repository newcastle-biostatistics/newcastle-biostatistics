Eggcell is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's i4i Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/invention-for-innovation.htm) to CI Nilendran Prathalingam and team.

It is a multicentre prospective non-inferiority trial of women undergoing egg collection for IVF comparing the use of 'Eggcell' with standard procedures.
