ALTAR is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Chris Harding](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/chrisharding.html) and team.

It is a randomised multicentre pragmatic open-label phase IV non‐inferiority trial comparing two licensed treatments for the prevention of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women with rUTI.
Continuous low‐dose prophylactic antibiotic therapy is the current standard of care for the prevention of rUTI, however this can lead to an increase in antimicrobial resistance and subsequent difficult‐to‐treat infections.
The ALTAR trial is therefore designed to evaluate the clinical benefit, as assessed by the incidence of symptomatic antibiotic‐treated UTI's over 12 months, of the best candidate alternative treatment for the prevention of rUTI, the urinary antiseptic Methenamine hippurate (Hiprex®).
