MABSC is funded by a grant from the [NHMRC](https://www.health.gov.au/contacts/national-health-and-medical-research-council-nhmrc) to CI [Claire Wainwright](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/researchers-professor-claire-wainwright/) and team.

It is a platform trial to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic therapy combinations in clearing Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary disease.
It will provide a pipeline for new therapies to be evaluated for treating MABS-PD in all age groups.
