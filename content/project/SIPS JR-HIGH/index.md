SIPS JR-HIGH was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's PHR Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/public-health-research.htm) to CI [Dorothy Newbury-Birch](https://research.tees.ac.uk/en/persons/dorothy-newbury-birch) and team.

It was a two-arm individually randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alcohol screening and brief intervention (ASBI) for risky drinking in young people aged 14â€“15 years in the school setting, monitoring the fidelity of ASBI and exploring the barriers to, and facilitators of, implementation with staff, young people and parents.
