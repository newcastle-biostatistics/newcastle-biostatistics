SEED was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's PGfAR Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/programme-grants-for-applied-research.htm) to CI [Louise Robinson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/alrobinson.html) and team.

The programme aimed to support professionals to deliver good-quality, community-based care towards, and at, the end of life for people living with dementia and their families.

You can find out more from SEED's [website](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/seed/), or from it's [final report](https://doi.org/10.3310/pgfar08080).
