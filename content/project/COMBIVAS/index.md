COMBIVAS is funded by a grant from the [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/) to CI Rachel Jones and team.
It is sponsored by [Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/).

It is a proof of concept mechanistic RCT to assess whether dual B-cell immunotherapy by co-administration of rituximab and belimumab will result in improvements in biological endpoints, functional outcomes and clinical status compared to rituximab with placebo.
