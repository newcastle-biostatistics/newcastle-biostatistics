CONFORM-OH is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [James Frith](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/jamesfrith.html) and team.

There are several drugs that can potentially be used to treat orthostatic hypotension, including fludrocortisone and midodrine.
However, there is limited available evidence on the effectiveness of these treatments.
CONFORM-OH aims to address this, through a multi-centre open-label RCT evaluating treatment effectiveness via the Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire Symptom Score in 366 patients.
An interim analysis after the 200th participant will enable ineffective treatments to be dropped early from the trial.
