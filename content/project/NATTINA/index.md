NATTINA is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm/) to CI [Janet Wilson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/janetwilson2.html) and team.

It is a trial for adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis, looking to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of tonsillectomy compared with conservative management.
