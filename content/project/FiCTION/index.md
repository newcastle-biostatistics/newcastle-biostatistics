FiCTION was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Janet Clarkson](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/janet-clarkson) and team.

It was a multicentre, three-arm parallel-group, participant-randomised controlled trial, aiming to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three strategies for managing caries in primary teeth.
