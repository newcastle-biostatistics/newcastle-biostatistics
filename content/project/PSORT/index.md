PSORT is funded by a grant from the [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/) to CI [Chris Griffiths](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Christopher.Griffiths.html) and team.

It is a stratified medicine consortium formed by world leading dermatologists, industry partners including pharmaceutical companies and psoriasis patients.
Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition which affects more than 1.8 million people in the UK and can have a major impact of quality of life.
The overall research strategy is to identify stratifiers of response to biologic therapies for patients with psoriasis. 

You can find out more from PSORT's [website](http://www.psort.org.uk/), or from it's [award page](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR%2FL011808%2F1).
