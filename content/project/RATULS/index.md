RATULS was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Helen Rodgers](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/helenrodgers.html) and team.

It was a multicentre randomised controlled trial to determine whether robot assisted training improves upper limb function after stroke.
Robot assisted training was compared to i) an enhanced upper limb therapy programme consisting of repeated practice of everyday activities using the arm and ii) usual NHS rehabilitation.
