RITPBC was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's EME Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/efficacy-and-mechanism-evaluation.htm) to CI [David Jones](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/davidjones.html) and team.

It was a single-centre phase II, double-blind, RCT comparing rituximab with placebo in fatigued Primary Biliary Cholangitis patients.
