VARIANT is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's RfPB Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/research-for-patient-benefit.htm) to CI [Rakesh Heer](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/rakeshheer.html) and team.

It is a feasibility study in which the researchers will look at whether doctors and patients are willing to use the results of a blood test to decide on a treatment option.
