Do-Well was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's PHR Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/public-health-research.htm) to CI [Martin White](https://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/people/martin-white/) and team.

It was a pragmatic, individually randomised, parallel-group, single-blinded, wait-list controlled trial to establish the acceptability, cost-effectiveness and effect on health of a domiciliary welfare rights advice service targeting older people, compared with usual practice.
