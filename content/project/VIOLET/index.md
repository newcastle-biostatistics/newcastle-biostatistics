VIOLET was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's PHR Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/public-health-research.htm) to CI [Nicola Adams](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/our-staff/a/nicola-adams/) and team.

It aimed to develop an adapted training package, and then perform a pilot trial to investigate whether a full-scale randomised controlled trial of the intervention was feasible.

You can find out more from VIOLET's [final report](https://doi.org/10.3310/phr07040), or from it's registration on [ISRCTN](https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16949845).
