EMPOWER is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Stephen Robson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/scrobson.html) and team.

It aims to compare the effectiveness of two drugs (metoclopramide and ondansetron) for treating women with severe symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.
