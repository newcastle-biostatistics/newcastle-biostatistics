NAIROS is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI [Janet Wilson](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/janetwilson2.html) and team.

It is a phase III, open-label, mixed-methods, multicentre RCT to establish, and inform guidance for, the best management strategy for individuals with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated septum.
