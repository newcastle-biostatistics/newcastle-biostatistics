RiGD is funded by a grant from the [Medical Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/) to CI [Tim Cheetham](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/timothycheetham.html) and team.

It aims to examine whether the effects of rituximab increase the likelihood of Graves' hyperthyroidism resolving in young people, when administered in association with an abbreviated course of standard Carbimazole treatment.
