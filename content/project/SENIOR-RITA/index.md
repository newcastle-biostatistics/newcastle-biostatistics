SENIOR-RITA is funded by a grant from the [BHF](https://www.bhf.org.uk/) to CI [Vijay Kunadian](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/vijaykunadian.html) and team.

It is considering patients 75 and over presenting with Type 1 Non Segment Myocardial Infaction (NSTEMI).
The main objective is to determine whether patients would benefit from invasive treatment, which involves patients undergoing an angiography followed by the possible surgical intervention via Percuatenous Coronary Intervention or Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.
