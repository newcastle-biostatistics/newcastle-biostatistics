SOLID is funded by a grant from the [NIHR's PHR Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/public-health-research.htm) to CI [Eileen Kaner](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/eileenkaner.html) and team.

It aimed to investigate the feasibility of a definitive RCT comparing two behaviour change interventions to reduce risky substance use (illicit drugs and alcohol) and improve the mental health of children in care aged 12–20 years.
