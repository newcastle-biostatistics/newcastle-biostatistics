AnTIC was funded by a grant from the [NIHR's HTA Programme](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm) to CI Robert Pickard and team.

It was conducted to find out whether or not taking a daily low dose of antibiotic (prophylaxis) over 12 months was better than not taking prophylaxis in reducing the rate of infection for people carrying out CISC who suffer from repeated UTIs.

You can find out more from AnTIC's [final report](https://doi.org/10.3310/hta22240), or from it's registration on [ISRCTN](https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN67145101).
