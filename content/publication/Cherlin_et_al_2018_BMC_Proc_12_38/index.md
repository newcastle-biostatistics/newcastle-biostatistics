abstract = """In a typical genome-enabled prediction problem there are many more predictor variables than response variables. This prohibits the application of multiple linear regression, because the unique ordinary least squares estimators of the regression coefficients are not defined. To overcome this problem, penalized regression methods have been proposed, aiming at shrinking the coefficients toward zero."""
