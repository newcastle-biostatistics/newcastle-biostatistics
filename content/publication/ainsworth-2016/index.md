abstract = """We explore causal relationships between genotype, gene expression and phenotype in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 data. We compare the use of structural equation modeling and a Bayesian unified framework approach to infer the most likely causal models that gave rise to the data. Testing an exhaustive set of causal relationships between each single-nucleotide polymorphism, gene expression probe, and phenotype would be computationally infeasible, thus a filtering step is required. In addition to filtering based on pairwise associations, we consider weighted gene correlation network analysis as a method of clustering genes with similar function into a small number of modules. These modules capture the key functional mechanisms of genes while greatly reducing the number of relationships to test for in causal modeling."""
