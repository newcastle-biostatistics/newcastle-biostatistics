abstract = """We conducted a genome-wide association study for testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), genotyping 307,666 SNPs in 730 cases and 1,435 controls from the UK and replicating associations in a further 571 cases and 1,806 controls. We found strong evidence for susceptibility loci on chromosome 5 (per allele OR = 1.37 (95% CI = 1.19–1.58), P = 3 × 10−13), chromosome 6 (OR = 1.50 (95% CI = 1.28–1.75), P = 10−13) and chromosome 12 (OR = 2.55 (95% CI = 2.05–3.19), P = 10−31). KITLG, encoding the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, which has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of TGCT and the biology of germ cells, may explain the association on chromosome 12."""
