abstract = "The Kety-Schmidt technique for the measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been in use for many years, but efficient statistical methods for producing estimates of CBF have received little attention. This paper proposes simple statistical models for this problem and explores their properties using data from a recent study of severe head injury in children. The method, which can readily be implemented on a personal computer, allows the uncertainty in the estimate of CBF to be quantified."
