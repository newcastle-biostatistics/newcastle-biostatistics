abstract = """A significant proportion of the variation between individuals in gene expression levels is genetic, and it is likely that these differences correlate with phenotypic differences or with risk of disease. Cis-acting polymorphisms are important in determining interindividual differences in gene expression that lead to allelic expression imbalance, which is the unequal expression of homologous alleles in individuals heterozygous for such a polymorphism. This expression imbalance can be detected using a transcribed polymorphism, and, once it is established, the next step is to identify the polymorphisms that are responsible for or predictive of allelic expression levels. We present an expectation-maximization algorithm for such analyses, providing a formal statistical framework to test whether a candidate polymorphism is associated with allelic expression differences."""
