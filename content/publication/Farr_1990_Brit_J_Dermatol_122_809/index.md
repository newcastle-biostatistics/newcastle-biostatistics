abstract = """The effect of terfenadine on the response to irradiation with blue light was measured in seven patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria. Terfenadine caused significant inhibition of the immediate flare reaction, but did not alter the erythemal response localized to the irradiation sites. Treatment with $β$-carotene had no effect on the flare and erythemal responses. However, the flare reaction was still inhibited by terfenadine during treatment with $β$-carotene. These results show that histamine release is involved in the mechanism of porphyrin photosensitivity. H1 receptor antagonists may be of use in the treatment of patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria."""
