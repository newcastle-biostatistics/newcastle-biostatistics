abstract = """Background and Objective: Despite its important role in cancer treatment, there is currently very limited available information concerning the clinical pharmacology of actinomycin D (Act D). The study was designed to characterise Act D pharmacokinetics and investigate the impact of pharmacogenetic variation on Act D disposition in children with cancer.

Methods: A total of 650 plasma samples collected over an 8 year period from 117 patients ≤21 years receiving Act D (0.4–1.6 mg/m2) were used to characterise a population pharmacokinetic model. Polymorphisms in ABCB1 were analysed in 140 patients.

Results: A 3-compartment model provided a good fit to the data. Median values for Act D clearance and volume of distribution in the central compartment (V 1) obtained from the model were 5.3 L/h and 1.9 L (13.9 L/h/70 kg and 7.5 L/70 kg), respectively. There was substantial inter-subject variation in all pharmacokinetic parameters (coefficients of variation 53–81 % for non-normalised values). Body weight was a major determinant of Act D clearance, such that dose capping at 2 mg in larger children at a protocol dose of 1.5 mg/m2 resulted in significantly lower area under the plasma concentration-time curves (mean AUC values: 9.3 versus 12.8 mg·min/L; P < 0.0001). No significant relationships were found between ABCB1 genetic variants and Act D pharmacokinetic parameters, nor between CL, V 1 or dose and incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity.

Conclusion: We have defined the pharmacokinetics of Act D in a paediatric patient population, providing robust estimates of key pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic data bring into question the current clinical practice of dose capping at 2 mg in larger patients. Pharmacogenetic variation in candidate drug transporter genes identified from preclinical studies does not significantly impact on Act D exposure in a clinical setting."""
