abstract = """We have investigated the differences between the sexes in the development of contact sensitivity induced by dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). Ten male and 12 female subjects were sensitized with DNCB (30 $μ$g applied on a 1 cm patch test disc) and challenged 1 month later with doses of 8.8, 12.5, 17.7 and 25 $μ$g. The responses were measured after 48 h as increase in skinfold thickness with Harpenden callipers. Females showed a larger response at all challenge doses studied, and the slope of the log-dose response curve was significantly steeper in females. We conclude that there are significant differences in delayed type hypersensitivity between males and females."""
