abstract = """Studies investigating the relationship between common genetic variants and cancer risk are being reported with rapidly increasing frequency. We have identified 46 published case-control studies that have examined the effect of common alleles of 18 different genes on breast cancer risk. Of these, 12 report statistically significant associations, none of which were reported by more than one study. However, many of the studies were small: 10 of the 46 had 80% power or greater to detect a rare allele homozygote relative risk textless2.5. We therefore combined the results of individual studies to obtain more precise estimates of risk. Statistically significant differences in genotype frequencies were found in three case-control comparisons of unselected cases. These were for CYP19 (TTTA)n polymorphism [(TTTA)10 carrier odds ratio (OR) = 2.33; P = 0.002], the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism (Val carrier OR = 1.60; P = 0.02), and the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism (Pro carrier OR = 1.27; P = 0.03). In addition, the GSTM1 gene deletion was found to be significantly associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (null homozygote OR = 1.33; P = 0.04). There was also some evidence that homozygotes for the PR PROGINS allele are protected against breast cancer, although this result was of borderline statistical significance. For polymorphisms in BRCA1, COMT, CYP17, CYP1A1, NAT1, and NAT2, the best estimate of risk either from the individual studies or the meta-analyses was sufficiently precise to exclude a relative risk of 1.5 or greater. For the polymorphisms in EDH17B2, ER, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, GSTT1, HSP70, and TNF$Î±$, the risk estimates, although nonsignificant, were insufficiently precise to exclude a moderate risk (textgreater1.5). Precise estimation of the risks associated with these and other as yet untested genes, as well as investigation of more complex risks arising from gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, will require much larger studies."""
