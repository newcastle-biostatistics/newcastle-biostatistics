abstract = """We have read the recent letter from Braillon and appreciate his interest in our work. We would like to reply to a few specific comments that he raised. While we certainly agree that meta-analyses should be pre-registered, pooled analyses based on individual-level data are not considered systematic reviews and thus, PRISMA or Cochrane would not be appropriate sources to pre-register such an analysis. Further, while we are highly supportive of open science platforms, it is not routine to pre-register observational analyses."""
