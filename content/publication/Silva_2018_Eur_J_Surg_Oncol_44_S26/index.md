abstract = """Background: The emergence of targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors in recent years is dramatically improving the prognosis for melanoma patients. By detecting melanoma relapses sooner, we could initiate these treatments earlier, potentially improving outcomes. Genetic profiles of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) can potentially be utilised as easily accessible biomarkers."""
