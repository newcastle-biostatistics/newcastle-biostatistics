abstract = """Background: Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) is associated with syncope, unexplained falls, and drop attacks in older people but occurs asymptomatically in 35% of community‐dwelling elders. We hypothesized that impaired cerebral autoregulation is associated with the conversion of asymptomatic CSH to symptomatic CSH. We therefore conducted a case–control study evaluating individuals with CSH with and without the symptoms of syncope or unexplained falls, as well as non‐CSH controls, to determine whether the blood pressure and heart rate changes associated with CSH are associated with symptoms only when cerebral autoregulation is altered.

Methods and Results: Bilateral middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (BFV) were measured in consecutive patients with symptomatic CSH (n=22) and asymptomatic controls with (n=18) and without CSH (n=14) using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography during lower body negative pressure‐induced systemic hypotension. Within‐group comparisons revealed significantly lower cerebrovascular resistance index (CVRi) at nadir for the asymptomatic CSH group (right, mean [95% CI]: 2.2 [1.8, 2.8] versus 2.6 [2.2, 3.0]; P=0.005; left: 2.8 [2.4, 3.3] versus 3.1 [2.7, 3.8]; P=0.016). Between‐group comparisons showed higher mean BFV (right: estimated mean difference, B=5.49 [1.98, 8.80], P=0.003; left: 4.82 [1.52, 8.11], P=0.005) and lower CVRi (right: B=0.08 [0.03, 0.12], P=0.003, left: B=0.07 [0.02, 0.12], P=0.006) in asymptomatic CSH versus symptomatic CSH groups. There were no significant differences in bilateral mean BFV or right CVRi between the non‐CSH and symptomatic CSH groups but differences were present for left CVRi (B=0.07 [0.02, 0.013], P=0.015).

Conclusion: Cerebral autoregulation is altered in symptomatic CSH and therefore appears to be associated with the development of hypotension‐related symptoms in individuals with CSH."""
