abstract = """Primary nonfunction in renal allografts makes the diagnosis of allograft dysfunction more difficult and may effect long-term graft survival. The prevention of primary nonfunction by a reperfusion technique has been assessed in a prospective analysis of 145 consecutive renal transplants performed in a single center. All kidneys were retrieved using an in situ perfusion method, and all but 13 recipients received a standardized immunosuppressive protocol with cyclosporine. The first 106 transplants were performed without the benefit of any additional perfusion, and the incidence of primary nonfunction was 57.5% in these patients. The last 39 kidneys received additional perfusion with kidney perfusion fluid immediately prior to implantation (late perfusion). In the latter group, the incidence of primary nonfunction was 30.8% (P = 0.007). Using logistic regression analysis, only three factors were found to be associated with primary nonfunction: immunosuppression with cyclosporine (P = 0.01), a second warm ischemia time of greater than 35 min (P = 0.002), and late perfusion (P = 0.003). In this study, the use of late perfusion alone has reduced the incidence of primary nonfunction by almost one half. The technique is simple, safe, inexpensive, and effective. Its routine use is now advocated in all renal transplants."""
