abstract = """Objective: To explore the association between ethnicity, sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors, and physical performance (PP) in ethnically diverse community-dwelling older adults from one geographic area. Method: We used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with upper (grip strength [GS], arm curls [AC]) and lower (chair stands [CS]) body strength and mobility (gait speed [GSp]) in 577 older adults (mean age 74 Â± 8; 104 African American, 142 Afro-Caribbean, 123 Hispanic, and 208 European American) from South Florida. Results: Worse mental health was negatively associated with CS in African Americans and AC in Hispanics. Older age and higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with slower GSp in all except in Hispanics. Higher physical activity was associated with higher upper body strength in Hispanics and better mobility in African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans, but not in European Americans. Conclusion: Studies with large multiethnic cohorts are needed to further our understanding of ethnic differences in PP, which will help in tailoring interventions and recognizing unmet needs for health and social services."""
