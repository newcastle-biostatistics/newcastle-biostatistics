abstract = """High-dimensional biomarkers such as genomics are increasingly being measured in randomized clinical trials.
Consequently, there is a growing interest in developing methods that improve the power to detect biomarker-treatment
interactions. We adapt recently proposed two-stage interaction detecting procedures in the setting of randomized clinical
trials. We also propose a new stage 1 multivariate screening strategy using ridge regression to account for correlations among
biomarkers. For this multivariate screening, we prove the asymptotic between-stage independence, required for the family-wise
error rate control, under the biomarker-treatment independence. Simulation results show that in various scenarios, the ridge
regression screening procedure can provide substantially greater power than the traditional one-biomarker-at-a-time screening
procedure in highly correlated data. We also exemplify our approach in two real clinical trial data applications."""
