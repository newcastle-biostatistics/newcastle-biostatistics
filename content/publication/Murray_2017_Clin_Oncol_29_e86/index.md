abstract = """Aims: Erectile dysfunction remains a common toxicity of prostate radiotherapy despite technological advancements [1]. Penile bulb (PB) dose has been proposed as a predictor of EP post-radiotherapy, however, PB dose-volume effects are not well established. We aim to determine the dose-response characteristics of the PB in men treated within a randomised trial assessing prostate IGRT using patient- and physician-reported outcomes."""
