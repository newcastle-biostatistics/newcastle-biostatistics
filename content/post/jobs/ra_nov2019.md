An opportunity is available for a statistician to work with [James Wason](/staff/james_wason/) in the PHSI-BRG.
This position will involve working on a mix of methodological research related to precision medicine clinical trials and to work on funded clinical trials using innovative design and analysis approaches.

This role is part of a sizeable expansion of the PHSI-BRG, including new academic positions, research positions, and PhD studentships, which will be advertised in late 2019.

To be appointable as a Research Associate, you will be a suitably qualified statistician (with either a PhD, or a postgraduate qualification with a track record of published research and evidence of being able to conduct statistical methodology research) interested in working on novel statistical methodology and applying it in real trials.
There will be opportunities to be involved in the supervision of PhD students and get involved in designing future clinical trials.

To be appointable as a Senior Research Associate, you will have some postdoctoral experience with impressive research outputs.
You will show ability to work independently and excellent promise to develop your own area of research as an independent investigator.

Informal enquiries may be made to [James Wason](/staff/james_wason/) via e-mail to [james.wason@ncl.ac.uk](mailto:james.wason@ncl.ac.uk).
