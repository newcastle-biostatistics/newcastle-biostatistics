title: Two funded PhD positions
---

We are currently advertising two fully-funded PhD studentships.
All projects include funding for UK/EU university fees and a tax-free stipend at UKRI rates (currently Â£15,009 per annum but due to increase in line with inflation by the time the project starts).
Although funding for non-EU candidates is available, the additional university fees are not covered.
The deadline for applications is December 11th 2020.
The projects will start in September 2020 (or potentially at a different time if suitable for the candidate).
The projects available (and links to more details and how to apply) are below:
